Every '@cmd' tag before a function defines an individual command
that can be called independently from the terminal.
Some times the name of this command is too long, or there other
ways to describe the same command. When that happens, you can
use the '@alias' tag and provide a different way of calling
this command.

./examples/output/commands-aliases.sh: line 120: @alias: command not found
Another good use-case of the  tag is for deprecating
commands.
