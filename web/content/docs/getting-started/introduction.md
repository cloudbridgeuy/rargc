**Rargs** is a Bash framework inspired by [Bashly](https://bashly.dannyb.co/) and [Argc](https://github.com/sigoden/argc). It's designed to make it easier to create feature-rich command-line tools with Bash.

With **Rargs**, you get help with:

- Writing helpful messages.
- Parsing arguments, flags, and options.
- Managing environment variables.
- Checking script dependencies.
- Using sub-commands.
- Creating built-in documentation.

It's not the only tool out there, but it's unique because it lets you do everything in one file without runtime dependencies. Your script functions stay separate and easy to manage, all while enjoying **Rargs**' features.
