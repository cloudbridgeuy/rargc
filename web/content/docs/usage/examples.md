On the following sections you'll see different examples on how to solve common problems
when creating scripts with **Rargs**.

## Long Help Output

Most **Rargs** decorators can be used to improve the usage output of you script. Nonetheless
there may be times where you want to include more than a single line of information, or
split the lines between other configuration to better explain the logic behind it.

You can use the `@@` decorator to do exactly this. Every commend decorated with this
operator will be parsed as a single value of the help message, and will be appended appropriately
in the usage output.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# @name minimal
# @version 0.0.1
# @description Flags examples

# @@ You can use the @help decorator to split the output of your usage
# @@ message into multiple lines.
# @@
# @@ You can also interleave these lines with other decorators.
# @arg name="World" Name of the entity to greet
#
## Double '#' Can be used to add comments that won't be treated as part
## of the usage output.
#
# @@
# @@ You can continue with the usage text here. Notice how you can implement
# @@ empty new lines by using only the @@ decorator.
root() {
  echo "Hello $rargs_name"
}
```

## Any parameters

Use the `@any` decorator to configure the script or a command to parse a dynamic list
of additional arguments. This can be useful when we want to handle parsing the arguments
ourselves, or when we need to pass them to a different script or binary.

You can reference the additional arguments inside your scripts through the `rargs_other_args`
variable, defined as an array of values.

```bash
cat <<-'EOF' | rargs run - -h
# @help Show how to use the @any decorator.
# @any <GIT_ARGUMENTS> Git command arguments and options.
root() {
	echo "Pass the additional arguments to an external app like git."
	git ${rargs_other_args[@]}
}
EOF
```

Just as other arguments decorators, the `@any` decorator accepts a value notation script
and a description to include in the usage output.

## Environment Variables

**Rargs** can help you enforce the existence of pre-defined environment variables, and
allows you to overwrite `options` and `arguments` with the values of environment
variables.

To use this feature use `@env` decorator at the script or command scope.

### Required Environment Variable

Use the `!` operator to mark an environment variable as required.

```bash
# @env REQUIRED_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE!
```

### Assign an environment variable to a command or argument

To assign the value of an environment variable to a positional argument or an option,
use the `:` operator followed by the name of the variable you want to assign the value to.

```bash
# @arg positional-argument! Positional argument
# @option -e --example Example Option
# @env POSITIONAL_ARGUMENT:positional-argument
# @env EXAMPLE:example
```

> You can't mark an environment variable as required with the `!` operator when assigning
> its value to another variable. If you need to enforce the requirement of this value
> use the `!` operator on the `@arg` or `@option` definition.

## Dependencies

Most script require external dependencies to be available in the `$PATH` during its
execution. This could be binaries or other scripts. **Rargs** exposes the `@dep` decorator
to ensure that all the required binaries or scripts are available on runtime. It
also allows you to set an error message, which you can use to give the user instructions
on how to install the missing dependency.

```bash
# @dep curl Please install curl with brew install curl or apt install curl
```

If you want to add some colors, add the appropriate ANSI escape codes to the message.

```bash
# @dep curl Please install \e[32mcurl\e[0m with \e[32mbrew install curl\e[0m or \e[32mapt install curl\e[0m
```

You can also provide a list of dependencies as strings separated by a comma (`,`) and
can personalize the message by referring to the missing dependency as `$dep` when
writing your help message.

```bash
# @dep curl,jo Please install \e[32m$dep\e[0m with \e[32mbrew\e[0m or \e[32maapt-get\e[0m
```

## Rules

Even though **Rargs** has a lot of opinions on how to write CLI applications, it still offer
some escape hatches that you can use to tune your script just how you want. Rules are one
big way to do this.

Basically, setting up a rule changes a core behavior of **Rargs** either at the `root` or
`command` scope. You can use it to disable the `--help` flags, or change the way that
it should trigger.

To set a rule use the `@rule` operator followed by the name of the rule you want to enforce.
If you set this inside the scope of an `@cmd` command, then the rule will only be applied
to the command, and not to the entire script.

On this section, we'll outline all the rules available.

### No first option help

By default, **Rargs** expects the `--help` option to be passed as the first argument of
the call. If you add any argument before you'll get an error message like this:

```bash
Invalid option: --help
```

The `no-first-option-help` rule disable this behavior, allowing you to provide the
`--help` option at any place, avorting the execution of the script, to present the
script usage information.

```bash
# @rule no-first-option-help
```

### No force default

This rule disable the `default` assigning mechanics of **Rargs**, letting you mark
an `option` or `argument` as having a default value, yet letting you decide on
your own how this value will be set.

```bash
# @rule no-force-default
```

### Use global deps for root.

Allow the usage of the `@dep` decorator at the global scope to work for scripts
with a single `root` command.

```bash
# @rule use-global-deps-for-root
```

### Use gloable envs for root

Allow the usage of the `@env` decorator at the global scope to work for sciprs
with a single `root` command.

```bash
# @rule use-global-envs-for-root
```

some examples that show the tool in action, that you can also use as inspiration
for your scripts.
